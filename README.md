Here is where people should store/share/submit their work.

In order for this to work, everyone should follow these basic guidelines:
- Greg will make a folder for each assignment
- Greg will post some folder heirarchy therein for that specific assignment which you should conform to (labeled gkiar, unless otherwise stated)
- You will create a directory named after your jhed id/github handle/i don't care just be consistent
- You will submit your work
- We will all be happy
